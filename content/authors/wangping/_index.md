Professor Wang Ping's team has closely integrated ultrafast femtosecond optics and molecular biology, continuously exploring the principles and technologies of biological imaging. In 2018, they successfully obtained stimulated Raman images with a resolution of 110nm at the cellular and tissue levels. Professor Wang Ping's team further combined the clinical needs of medicine to chemically discriminate and image cancer and tumor metabolic molecules. In the field of ultrafast technology, the team has successfully developed an ultrafast molecular imaging microscope capable of 2000 frames per second using dual-femtosecond laser technology. In the past decade, as the first author or corresponding author, Professor Wang Ping's team has published more than 10 representative high-quality papers in top-tier international journals under the Nature umbrella, such as Light: Science & Applications, Nature Communications, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., Advanced Sciences, JACS, Optica, Nano Letters, and Small, with a total of over 2000 citations (Google Scholar). Currently, he serves as a reviewer for important journals such as Nature Methods, Nature Chemical Biology, and Nature Communications.
